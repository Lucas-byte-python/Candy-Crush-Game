# üç¨ Candy Crush Game
## A fun and fully functional Candy Crush-inspired game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a thematic background that captures the colorful and playful essence of the original Candy Crush game.

# üéÆ How It Works
## The game board is a grid of candies (usually 8x8 or 10x10), where each cell represents a different candy type.
## Players can swap two adjacent candies.
## If the swap results in a line of three or more matching candies (horizontal or vertical), those candies are removed, and new ones fall into place.
## Each valid match increases the player's score, and the game continues until the player reaches a goal or runs out of time (depending on how it's set up).
